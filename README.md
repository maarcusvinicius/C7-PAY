<h1 align="center">C7 PAY 🏦</h1>

<p align="left">🔥An application that simulates adding a credit card via the Web, allowing you to check which card is with some variations of specific rules made with JavaScript!

<br />

The objective of the project is to improve the understanding of Clean Code, JavaScript and use of IMask for future projects accessible and easy to understand. The project was developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON, Node and NPM, Vite and iMask. There are some tasks in the Roadmap that haven't been completed yet, such as creating more card variations.

## 🔧 Updates

<br />

<p align="left">

The new feature added is a curiosity hidden in the application that is triggered by typing the number 1895 in the first digits of the card. By doing so, the application presents a skin of the Flamengo football team, as the team was founded on November 15, 1895. This is an interesting feature that can be used to entertain and surprise the application's users. It is worth mentioning that this functionality does not interfere with the main functionality of the application, and is just an additional curiosity for users who want to explore the application further.

</div>

## 🎡 Functionalities

- Credit Card Addition: Users can add their credit card information including card number, expiration date, security code and cardholder name

- Credit card validation: the application verifies that the information entered by the user corresponds to a valid credit card, using credit card validation algorithms
